# MERN Recipe Project

The MERN Recipe Project is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize recipes into customizable recipe boxes. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), the project demonstrates a modular, scalable architecture suitable for personal or collaborative cooking and meal planning.
---

## Overview

This project is divided into two main components:

### Backend (API)

A RESTful API built with Express and MongoDB, responsible for:

- Managing recipe and recipe box data
- Handling CRUD operations
- Structuring data using Mongoose models
- Serving as the data layer for the frontend

### Frontend (Client)

A responsive React application that:

- Provides an intuitive UI for browsing and managing recipes
- Connects to the backend API for data interaction
- Offers a clean user experience for organizing recipes into boxes

---

## Deployment

The project is designed for cloud deployment using:

- **Render** for the backend (Node.js + MongoDB)
- **Netlify** for the frontend (React)

See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for full deployment instructions.

---

## Testing & Development

Each part of the project can be run independently for local development. Environment variables are used to configure API endpoints and database connections.

---

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing recipes and boxes
- **Express.js** – Backend framework for API routing
- **React** – Frontend library for building the user interface
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment for the backend
- **Axios** – HTTP client for API communication
- **Netlify & Render** – Deployment platforms
